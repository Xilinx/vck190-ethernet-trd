Known Issues
============

* In case petalinux booting fails in SD boot mode with the below log, press the push button switch (SW2) on the vck190 board.

   ```
   [9509.644]PMC EAM ERR1: 0x20000
   [9512.478]Received EAM error. ErrorNodeId: 0x28100000, Register Mask: 0x20000. The corresponding Error ID: 0x11
   [9549.658]PMC EAM ERR1: 0x20C00
   [9549.706]Received EAM error. ErrorNodeId: 0x28100000, Register Mask: 0x400. The corresponding Error ID: 0xA
   [9559.017]Received EAM error. ErrorNodeId: 0x28100000, Register Mask: 0x800. The corresponding Error ID: 0xB   
   ```  

* PTP application may give time out error when CPU load is high. By default, PTP application waits for Tx timestamp.If timestamp is not obtained within the specified wait time then PTP application gives timeout error.

* When running iperf, the user is expected to see a slightly lower throughput on the port on which dhcp server or other broadcast apps are running.

* Enhanced PTP logic supports 1-step PTP operation at 25G speed only. There is no support for 1-step PTP operation at 10G.

* Enhanced PTP logic supports only L2 and UDP IPv4 PTP packets.

* In 25G UDP (MTU 9000) use case, when running iperf (as a server) + ptp (as a slave) on VCK190 board, PTP synchronization might fluctuate.
