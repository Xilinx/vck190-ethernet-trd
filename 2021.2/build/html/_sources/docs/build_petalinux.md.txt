Building Petalinux
================================================

Introduction
------------
This tutorial walks through the typical steps of creating and customizing a
bootable Linux image for the VCK190 Evaluation Board. 

In the follwing sections, you will:

1. Build the BSP with the default rootfs configuration.
2. Learn how to add your own Vivado or Vitis generated bitstream firmware
   components.

Prerequisites
--------------
1. PetaLinux 2021.2 tools installation

Accessing the Tutorial Reference Files
--------------------------------------

> **Note**: Skip the following steps if the design files have already been cloned and extracted to a working repository

1. Download the [2021.2](https://www.xilinx.com/member/forms/download/trd-license-versal.html?filename=vck190-ethernet-trd-2021.2.zip) TRD petalinux source files 
   
2. Navigate to the `xilinx-vck190-trd` which is the working directory.


To Build Designs and Petalinux in one step:
-------------------------------------------

1. Go to the working directory 

```
cd $working_dir/
``` 

Note: The xilinx-vck190-trd directory inside petalinux directory must have the .petalinux folder to build petalinux.

User needs to copy the .petalinux folder from the [default vck190 production bsp](https://www.xilinx.com/member/vck190_headstart.html) petalinux project.

2.	To build and  generate sdcard image (wic), run the following command. The Makefile calls a lower level Makefile to build petalinux. If a platform is not already available, it builds it.
```
make sdcard YES=1

```

Modifying/Configure the petalinux project manually
--------------------------------

The project needs to be configured with the xsa file from the Vivado project.

```
petalinux-config --get-hw-description=<path of xsa> --silentconfig

```

> **Note**: The xsa needs to match the platform and design selected in the previous step. 

Build the Image
---------------
Run the below commands to build and package the wic image in compressed format:

```
petalinux-build
petalinux-package --wic --wic-extra-args "-c xz"
```
> **Note** : Before running above command copy binary_container_1.xclbin into images/linux folder. 

The generated compressed image file will be located at
`images/linux/petalinux-sdimage.wic.xz`.

**Tip:** The generated wic file assumes a fixed partition size.
         The file size can be significantly lower by compressing the file e.g.
         using xz:

To uncompress wic file use following command 

```
xz -d -v images/linux/petalinux-sdimage.wic.xz
```

This generates a output file named
`images/linux/petalinux-sdimage.wic` with uncompressed wic file 

Flash the image on an SD card using Balena Etcher. This image is functionally
equivalent to the prebuilt sdcard image provided with package


Build the SDK
---------------
A cross-compilation SDK is useful for application development on a host machine
for a specific target architecture e.g. X86 host and ARM 64-bit target. Run the
below command to generate a cross-compilation that can be used outside the
PetaLinux:

```
petalinux-build -s
```

The resulting self-extracting shell script installer file is located at
`images/linux/sdk.sh`.

The SDK installer script can be copied to the application developer's host
machine and installed by simply running the script. Follow the prompts on the
screen.

```
$ images/linux/sdk.sh
PetaLinux SDK installer version  2021.2
============================================
Enter target directory for SDK (default: /opt/petalinux/ 2021.2): ./images/linux/sdk
```

Once the SDK is installed, source the file
`images/linux/sdk/environment-setup-aarch64-xilinx-linux`
to set up the cross-development environment.
